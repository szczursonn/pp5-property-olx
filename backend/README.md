# backend
## Setup (dev)
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/szczursonn/pp5-property-olx
cd pp5-property-olx/backend
```
2. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
poetry install
```
3. Setup the DB
```
. scripts/quicksetup.sh
```
Superuser email: superuser@gmail.com.invalid  
Superuser password: qwerty123  
*Note: generated city and street names don't match their coordinates - generated offers are based around Krak√≥w between lat 49.3, 50.8 and lng 19.1, 20.9*  

4. Run the server
```
python3 manage.py runserver --ipv6
```  
*Use ipv6 when using localhost because for some reason sveltekit's server-side fetch resolves localhost to [::1]*

5. Setup the scheduled task in admin panel and run django-q in another shell (optional)  
`func: tasks.deactivate_expired_offers`
```
python3 manage.py qcluster
```
